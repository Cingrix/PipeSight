🧠 Automated Defect Detection using Image Processing & Deep Learning
💡 Project Overview
This project is designed to automate the detection of defects in images using a combination of image processing techniques and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The primary goal is to assist industries in enhancing quality control by quickly and accurately identifying defective regions in product images.

⚙️ Key Features
🔍 Defect Extraction: Uses image masks to extract defect areas from the original images.

🏷️ Label Automation: Automatically generates labels (Defect / No Defect) based on extracted image data.

🤖 Deep Learning Model: A lightweight CNN built using PyTorch for binary classification of defects.

💾 Batch Processing: Efficiently processes and labels large sets of training and test images.

📊 Prediction Output: Generates CSV reports with predicted defect statuses for easy review.

🗂️ Project Workflow
Defect Extraction
Original images and their corresponding ground truth masks are processed. The mask isolates the defective region, creating a clean dataset of defect patches.

Label Generation
Each extracted image is labeled as 1 (Defect Present) or 0 (No Defect) based on pixel inspection.

Model Building
A custom CNN is trained to classify images as defective or non-defective. The model uses convolutional layers for feature extraction and fully connected layers for classification.

Model Training & Evaluation
The model is trained on the labeled dataset, validated, and saved for later inference.

Inference on Test Set
The saved model is used to predict defects on new, unseen test images. The predictions are saved as a .csv file for review.
